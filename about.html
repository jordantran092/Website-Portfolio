                        Hi! Iâ€™m Jordan, and I am a student studying Computer Science at York University. I chose to pursue this path because I fell in love with the art of programming early on. From the action of reasoning with logic and the outcome of software being built, this is what I came to appreciate in the art of programming which is why I am here today.

                At large size breakpoint or less, it will go to max width and max width has been custom set so that it doesn't take up full width and stays small using picture-width class. 
                
                The img is able to be responsive because it is relative to the col, and the col is responsive itself due to grid system 
                
                Must put text-center because img no longer centered after col's breakpoint -->
